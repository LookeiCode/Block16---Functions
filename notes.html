Using the following criteria, your first assignment is to create the logic for their checkout system that returns the total cost of all refills including if the customer has a subscription and/or a coupon.

* If a customer has a subscription, the customer will receive a 25% discount after the refill total has been calculated.

* If the customer has a coupon, the customer will receive a $10 discount after the subscription discount has been calculated.

* At the end of the script, you should return and log the string "Your grand total is ${finalAmount}." 


Remember, a function should only do one task.
The returns of these functions should be stored in a variable, allowing other functions to use the result.

Timmy => "Your grand total is $65"
Sarah => "Your grand total is $37.5."
Rocky => "Your grand total is $102.5"

************************************************************

    discounts:

if (customer has subscription) {
  price = price * 0.75;
}

if (customer has discount) {
  price = price - 10;
}

return `your grand total is ${price}`;

1. reusable code
2. separating out your code into different steps

function takeSteakOutOfFridge() {

}

function seasonSteak() {

}

function putPanOntoStove() {

}

function throwSteakOntoPan() {

}

function cookSteak() {
  const beef = takeSteakOutOfFridge();

  const seasonedSteak = seasonSteak(beef);
  
  const pan = getPanOutOfOven();
}
